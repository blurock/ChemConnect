<body>
	A project represents a coherent set of experiments. In terms of data
	sets, a project is one data set made up of the data points representing
	the set of experiments.
	<br> Within the project is a connected set of apparati,
	experiments, data points and their corresponding information. These
	attributes within the project definition are linked together depending
	on the type of information conveyed.
	<br> Some important definitions within a project are:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Project Description</b> The top level project description
			is the same as a data set. The project is identified by the 'Source'
			and 'Keyword'
		<li><b>References</b>Publications related to the apparatus
		<li><b>Experiment</b>
		<li><b>Apparatus Specification</b> Associated with experiments
			(within a project) is a set of apparati. The specific apparatus
			description is derived from a generic description of the apparatus
			within the ChemConnect database. The generic description has
			'standard' description elements that can/should be specified by the
			specific configuration. An specific apparatus is defined at the
			'Source' level, i.e. a particular lab, or at the public level which
			could be defined by ChemConnect to by other sources which were made
			public.
			<ul>
				<li><b>Configuration Specification</b>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Generic Type</b> A keyword describing the generic type
							of apparatus
						<li><b>Keyword</b> A keyword specification of this particular
							device
						<li><b>Description</b> A longer description of the apparatus
						
						<li><b>Attribute-Value pair</b> A keyword describing an
							apparatus property and a value, usually a standard keyword,
							describing that attribute.
						<li><b>Image</b> An image that further describes the
							apparatus. This is could be, for example, a picture of the actual
							apparatus in the experiment or a schema of the experimental setup
							to be used as a reference to attributes needed to describe the
							particular apparatus.
						<li><b>References</b>Publications related to the apparatus
						<li><b></b>
					</ul>
				<li><b></b>
				<li><b></b>
				<li><b></b>
			</ul>
		<li><b>Experimental Data Point</b>
		<li><b></b>
		<li><b>Attribute-Value pair</b> Attribute value pairs are used
			throughout the specifications. The attributes are defined system wide
			and have an associated description. If the user wants a new
			attribute, this can be defined by giving the attribute string label,
			a description of the attribute and the datatype attributed to the
			value. The associated value is meant to be a single keyword. However,
			if necessary, data objects can be specified.
	</ul>
